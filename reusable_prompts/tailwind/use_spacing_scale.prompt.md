Use Tailwind's spacing and sizing scale consistently throughout the project.

Review all spacing usage and:
- Replace arbitrary spacing values with consistent scale values
- Apply spacing systematically across components
- Maintain visual rhythm and alignment
- Ensure consistent padding and margin usage
- Use the appropriate scale for different contexts (components, layouts, etc.)
