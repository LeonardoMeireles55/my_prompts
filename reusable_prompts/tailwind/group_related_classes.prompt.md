Group related utility classes for better readability and maintainability.

Organize Tailwind classes by category:
- Layout-related classes together (display, position, flexbox, grid)
- Spacing-related classes together (margin, padding)
- Typography-related classes together (font, text, line-height)
- Color-related classes together (background, text, border)
- Other categories as appropriate

This improves code organization and makes it easier to understand and modify styles.
