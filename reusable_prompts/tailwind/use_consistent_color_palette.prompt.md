Use a consistent color palette throughout the project and avoid arbitrary values.

Review all color usage in the codebase and:
- Replace any arbitrary color values with consistent palette colors
- Ensure color choices support accessibility standards (contrast ratios)
- Maintain consistency with existing design system or brand colors
- Apply colors systematically across components and pages
