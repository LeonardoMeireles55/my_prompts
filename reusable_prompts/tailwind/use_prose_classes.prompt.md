Use prose classes for content-rich areas to ensure consistent styling.

Apply appropriate prose classes to:
- Markdown-rendered content
- User-generated content areas
- Rich text editors
- Any content that benefits from semantic typography treatment

Ensure consistent typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy for textual content.
