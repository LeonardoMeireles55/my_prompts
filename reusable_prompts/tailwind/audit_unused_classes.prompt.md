Audit and remove unused classes with PurgeCSS to optimize bundle size.

Identify and remove:
- Unused Tailwind utility classes
- Dead code from the CSS output
- Classes that are no longer referenced in the codebase
- Duplicate or conflicting class definitions

Ensure the final CSS output is optimized and only includes necessary styles.
