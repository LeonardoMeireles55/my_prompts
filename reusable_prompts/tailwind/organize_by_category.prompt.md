Organize Tailwind CSS utility classes by category (layout, spacing, typography, etc.) for improved readability and maintainability.

Group related classes together:
- Layout classes (display, position, flexbox, grid)
- Spacing classes (margin, padding)
- Typography classes (font, text, line-height)
- Color classes (background, text, border)
- Other relevant categories

This improves code organization and makes it easier to understand and modify styles.
