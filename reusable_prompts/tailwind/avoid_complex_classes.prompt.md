Avoid overly complex class strings by extracting to components when needed.

Review class combinations and:
- Identify excessively long or complex class strings
- Extract complex patterns into dedicated components
- Break down monolithic class structures into manageable pieces
- Maintain visual consistency while improving code organization
- Ensure extracted components are reusable and well-documented
