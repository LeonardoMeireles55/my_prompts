### Next.js API Route Handler

Generate a Next.js API route handler with the following specifications:
- Use App Router API route structure (app/api/route.ts).
- Implement GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods as needed.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for request/response bodies.
- Include proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 500).
- Implement input validation.
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch blocks.
- Use NextRequest and NextResponse from 'next/server'.
- Add CORS headers if needed.
